# How does the described model-based testing approach overcome the typical limitations of (static) automated regression testing?
Answer this question by briefly referring to the described case.

The case study highlighted that traditional test case creation is mostly based on experience instead of
systematic methods and therefore either too many redundant test cases exist or whole areas of an application
remain untested. In model-based testing, models are developed for individual processes of an application.
From these models, test cases can be automatically generated that cover all transitions. The creation of
test cases from a model is thus based on a systematic approach and thus a good and consistent code coverage
can be achieved. Furthermore, fewer redundant test cases are generated. Furthermore, the case study points
out that the maintainability of test cases can be an enormous cost factor. In model-based testing, the
maintainability is much better, since only the model has to be adapted. All test cases can then be generated
again from the new model.

# Online and offline model-based testing

## What is the difference between online and offline model-based testing?

Online model-based testing means that test generation and execution occur directly after each other.
In this case, the tests cannot be further selected and cannot be used in other environments.
Offline model testing means that the test cases are first generated from the model.
These can subsequently be used like conventionally developed tests.
Thus, a selection can be made manually, the tests can be further developed and exported to other environments.

## Which of these two approaches has been used in the case study?

In the case study, the offline approach was chosen. This is made clear by the fact that the generation of the
test cases is done through the developed tool IDATG. The generated test cases can then be used in various tools
for test execution, such as "TestPartner".

# Return of Investment (ROI)

## What test strategies are compared in calculating the ROI?

In the return of investment calculation, manual testing was compared to the model-based approach.
Manual test cases refer to tests that have to be performed manually by testers at each run.

## When has the break-even point been reached?

The break-even point was reached after four test cycles. At this point, 855 hours were spent on
the model-based approach and 863 hours on the manual approach.

## What are potential problems in this calculation?

First, it should be noted that this calculation assumes that both manual testing and the
model-based approach detect exactly the same number of defects in the program. It is not
described in detail how effective both methods really worked. Furthermore, the time for
the manual tests was only estimated and since no manual tests were performed, only an
estimate could be made. Furthermore, very little is said about possible overhead costs.
For example, only the time needed to create the tests is calculated, but not the costs
for project management, coordination meetings and other costs. These overhead costs
could be significantly higher for new problems, since the uncertainty is higher and
the experience is less. Furthermore, the calculation is based on working hours only.
However, the costs for one person day can differ drastically. For example, if we
assume that an architect for models takes a much higher hourly rate than an usual
tester, because he has more specialized skills, the calculation could deviate further from reality.
